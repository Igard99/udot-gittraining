# udot-gittraining
A training presentation for UDOT on using Git and GitHub

This repository contains a quarto presentation that I gave to UDOT in Fall of 2014. The presentation teaches why we use git, and then leads into a hands-on training on how to 
  1. clone a repository
  2. create a branch
  3. make a commit
  4. push to a branch
  5. create a pull request

We use the command line for items 1, 2, 3, and 4. We then switch to 
GitHub Desktop to repeat steps 3 and 4 before doing step 5.
